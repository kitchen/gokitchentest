# what is this even

I tend to learn by doing. I also tend to forget silly little details like "is an empty array boolean false in perl?" (hint: it is).

Because I'm new to golang, I'm playing around with some new stuff I have not played around with before. This is a Good Thingâ„¢. Since I learn by doing, I tend to write little examples I can reference. Since golang has a really great testing framework, I figure I'll just use that. Since this might be useful to other folks, here's the stuff!

Enjoy!
